* Analyzing shipping status and how many shipments are completed per week. Create a new calculation and title it “Ship Status.” This new calculation should show whether the shipment was “Shipped on Time,” “Shipped Early,” or “Shipped Late.” Created a filled line chart showing the total number of shipments by order date. Colorized chart by shipping status, and add Order date, Ship Mode, and Ship Status to the filter. Filter by the Q4 2014 data only.

* Create a table showing total sales by product category, broken down by Year and Month. To complete this task, I created a new calculation titled “Sales Spotlight” that categorizes the total sales into “Good” if total sales are over $10,000, and “Bad” if total sales are lower than $10,000. Furthermore, I also created a Region filter, colorize table by Sales Spotlight field, and add Profit to Tooltip.Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yibing.qi#!/vizhome/SalesSpotlight_15707574612400/producyview?publish=yes).

* Create a dual layer map. The map shows total profit by postal code, colorized by profit ratio, and sized by total sales. Furthermore this map also shows Regions across the United States. Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yibing.qi#!/vizhome/mapsupersale/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
